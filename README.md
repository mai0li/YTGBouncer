## Overview

YTGBouncer is a project designed to interact with YouTube's API to manage and retrieve information about channel memberships.  
Leveraging such info, it manages access/removal of members according to membership tiers.

## Current Features

- ✅ Authenticate with YouTube API using OAuth 2.0
- ✅ List membership levels of a YouTube channel

## Future Features

- ⬜ Add support for retrieving channel member details
- ⬜ Distinguish members according to their member tier
- ⬜ Retrieving Telegram group members
- ⬜ Associating Telegram group members according to their Youtube IDs
- ⬜ For now, exporting a list of Telegram members that _should_ be purged in sheet format
- ⬜ In a near future, exporting membership list extraction onto a SQLite db so it can be compared in a sorta incremental routine
